## Project based on CNN to identify and locate bank card number , project use keras+OpenCV+PyQt
# Function
- [x]  Position Correction and Extraction of Bank Card Pictures 
- [x]  Data Preprocessing and Discrimination Model Training 
- [x]  Location and Recognition of Bank Card Number   
- [x]  Simple GUI    
## setup
pip install -r requirement.txt
## train your own model
Place the dataset in the dataset folder, label each category as the folder name, and use'model_train.py'under model_train. 
## Result
Demo.py can be used to achieve the simplest batch image recognition. The results are stored in 'result.txt'. The location map is as follows.
